## Things I'm learning üìì

I'm slowly working my way through rustlings / vimmotions, the appeal of working purely off keyboard is intoxicating. I've also been dabbling in training my own locally hosted LLMs but it's been somewhat messy. I'm not even sure what I'd use it for tbh, just the love of the game.
